# Restokit Architecture

RestoKit is a RESTful API designed to efficiently orchestrate orders, inventory, and deliveries in a restaurant environment.

---

## Core Principles

- **RESTful** – Resources are accessible through clear, explicit URLs.
- **Stateless**: Each request carries all the necessary information.
- **JSON** – A single data format for all communication.
- **JWT** – Secure token-based authentication.

## Key Components

| Component             | Role                                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client**            | Web, mobile, or third-party app consuming the API. |
| **API Server**        | Handles business logic, exposes REST endpoints.    |
| **Database**          | Stores users, orders, menus, and more.             |
| **External Services** | Payments, notifications, email delivery, etc.      |

## Typical Interaction Flow

1. The client authenticates via `/auth/login` → receives a JWT token.
2. It makes authenticated requests (`/menus`, `/orders`, etc.).
3. The server processes, validates, and responds.
4. Actions are logged for auditing or analytics.

## What This Architecture Enables

- **Scalability**: Decoupled components that are easy to scale.

- **Security**: Thanks to JWT, clear HTTP status codes, and separation of concerns.

- **Simplified Maintenance**: Modular structure and isolated business logic.
