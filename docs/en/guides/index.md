# Practical Guides

Welcome to the **Practical Guides** section of the RestoKit documentation.

Here, you'll find hands-on tutorials and real-world use cases to help you better understand how to interact with the RestoKit API.  
This section is perfect if you've already explored the core concepts and are ready to put them into practice.

## What you'll find here

- **Usage Examples**: Step-by-step guides for common operations such as creating an order, updating stock, or tracking a delivery.  
- **Postman Integration**: A ready-to-use collection of requests to test different API routes without writing a single line of code.

## Purpose

These guides are designed to:

- save you time during testing and integration,
- provide reusable templates,
- demonstrate how to combine RestoKit's features in real-world workflows.
